# Topics for discussion during meetings



## Thursday, May 14, 2020

### 1. Installing packages

Make sure this is done:
```r
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "knitr", "styler"))
```

### 2. Code style

This is **mandatory** reading: 
[https://style.tidyverse.org/](https://style.tidyverse.org/), at least, for
now, Chapters 1--7.

### 3. Roxygen

Make sure that the configurations are done on their projects. See and
follow directions at:  
[https://r-pkgs.org/man.html#man-workflow-2](https://r-pkgs.org/man.html#man-workflow-2)

Note that we have:
```
Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)
```
in the `DESCRIPTION` file.


### 4. Forking and Pull requests

Let's follow through the packages book.

```sh
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
```

Also set up upstream:
```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/eriqande/HatcheryPedAgree.git
```

Then, any time you want to get new commits from the upstream repo, you do:
```sh
git fetch upstream
```
That "fetches" the objects.

And, to merge them into your current branch, once they are fetched, you do:
```sh
git merge upstream/master
```

To be able to pull upstream into the current branch, you can set that up
with:
```sh
git branch -u upstream/master   
```

Then, to pull it into master you can:
```sh
git checkout master
git pull
```

To make it easier to work with branches, we installed
`.git-prompt.sh` and updates `PS1` to show the branch on our
bash prompt.




Be sure to get `upstream` set up.  Then run through the pull request procedure.


### 5. Data sets 

What format are these currently in?  I want to to have both of
the steelhead data sets in a canonical form to be in this project,
but have them gitignored. Then I will put the coho SNPs up on GitHub
for running through examples, etc.

I will send a specification of what I want, once I have figured
that out, and then Anne and Laura can email those to me and I can put them
together in a directory that we can send out to everyone.  That way we
can all test new functions on these private data sets.

**DON'T COMMIT THESE DATA SETS TO THE REPO!**



## For: Wednesday, May 20, 2020

### 1. Data set format

Laura and Anne, here is the format we want the main, initial datasets to be in:

* A tibble of genotypes that must have _at least_ these columns:
    1. `indiv`: the individual ID (could be, for example, the NMFS_DNA_ID
    2. `locus`: the name of the locus
    3. `gene_copy`: a column of 1's and 2's
    4. `allele_int`: a column of alleles, 1-4, with NA for missing data.
    
    These columns can be in any order, but ordered as above is natural.
Note that the genotypes can contain more columns.  For example, it could have a full
microhaplotype allele column, etc.  But for the SNP data sets, we don't really
need another one.

* A tibble of metadata relevant to the parentage. At this point I am thinking
that this includes:
    1. `indiv`
    2. `sex` a column of Male, Female, or NA
    3. `spawner_group`: typically the data of collection/spawning
    4. `year`: the year the individual was sampled/spawned
    
    Anne and Laura, can you think of anything else that belongs in here?
    
An example of these two data files can be found now by loading the package
which gives access to `coho_genotypes` and `coho_metadata`.  (You will have to pull
from upstream to master and load that version).

### 2. Let's talk about the `data` folder and `data.R`

* Just make sure we understand how package data can work.
* Talk about `extdata` too.

### 3. Matching samples

We need to do a few things here:

1. Function to convert to rubias format
2. Run rubias to find matching samples.
3. Find connected components.
4. Figure out which of the version of the individuals will be kept as the
canonical genotype.  

Along the way, we will want to investigate the results.  So, we will break this
down into different functions.

Here are some things to read about that we will use:

* [pivoting](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html).  This is gather/spread, but on steroids.  New
from the 'tidyr' package.
* [tidygraph](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/) Thomas Lin Pedersen's tidyverse 
solution to handling graphs and networks. TLP was an intern with Hadley at RStudio when he did gganinmate.
Now, he is still with RStudio, I think, and does amazing work.

I need you guys to get your steelhead data sets into that format so we can
have those to test on.


### 4. A little bit about NSE and rlang::enquo()

Weird stuff, but it will let us convert to rubias with microhaps, when we have those.

### 5. R CMD Check

Two main points here:

* Namespace addressing and Imports in Description.
* Visible bindings for 'global' variables.

### 1. Eric munges the RR and CV steelhead data sets

Both Anne and Laura have sent me their genotypes and metadata file.
They did a lot of the backend hard work, but I have a few things to do
here to clean them up.

#### CVSH

**Genotypes**: These all looked great.  I checked them, ungrouped the tibble
and then reordered the column names. I also arranged things so that all the
genotypes for an individual are together in one place.  This is not a necessity,
but it makes it easier to look at.

**Metadata**.  This looks good, but I caught a few issues:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# read in the original
cm <- read_rds("../private/as_sent/cvsh_meta.rds")

# It turns out that the hatchery names are not consistent. So we
# need to fix those. Also, I don't want spaces in those names.

# Note, we need to put spaces in hatchery names into a check() function.
cm2 <- cm %>%
  mutate(
    hatchery = recode(
      hatchery,
      `Coleman National Fish Hatchery` = "Coleman Hatchery",
      `Mokelumne Hatchery` = "Mokelumne River Hatchery",
      `Nimbus River Hatchery` = "Nimbus Hatchery"
    ),
    hatchery = str_replace_all(hatchery, " +", "_")
  )

# then i resaved that
write_rds(cm2, path = "../private/cvsh_metadata.rds", compress = "xz")
```


#### Russian River

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# having a look
rg <- read_rds("../private/as_sent/RR_steelhead_geno.rds")

# minor tweaks
rg %>% 
  select(indiv, locus, gene_copy, allele_int) %>%
  arrange(indiv, locus, gene_copy) %>%
  write_rds("../private/rrsh_genotypes.rds", compress = "xz")

# how about metadata?
# It needs ungrouping...
# hatchery names and sex look good
read_rds("../private/as_sent/RR_steelhead_meta.rds") %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  write_rds(path = "../private/rrsh_metadata.rds", compress = "xz")
```


## Week of Memorial Day (May 26--29)

### A Minor Revamp of snppit

After looking over Anne and Laura's data about the frequency of iteroparous
fish and also the occurrence of individuals that are spawned on multiple
days within a year (sometimes under different names), I realized that it might work
better to finish implementing `snppit` support for individuals to belong to multiple
spawner groups.  Looking over the code I see that it already has support for fish
to spawn in multiple years, and it should not take too much to allow individuals to
belong to multiple different spawner groups.  

I have done this with a few changes to the code.  I am doing it in a new branch 
of the snppit repo called `allow-multiple-spawner-groups`.  Here are the changes that
I made:  [https://github.com/eriqande/snppit/commit/5ccad7b2e619e14436df38a0d4d2086fbbe62d48](https://github.com/eriqande/snppit/commit/5ccad7b2e619e14436df38a0d4d2086fbbe62d48).

### Now that is done...

Still working on testing it, but now the drill for repeat spawners and "matching samples"
is to:

* standardize all occurrences to a single ID.  I think by convention we should use
the earliest occurrence.
* For occurrence as a candidate parent, we will include only a single row for the individual, but
we include all years that they occur in the year field (comma separated) and all
spawner groups in the spawner group field (also comma separated).  
* For the inclusion in the offspring field, we will include only their earliest occurrence
in the SNPPIT input file.


So, I must throw down some R code to do that...

## Friday, May 29, 2020

Some things we have dealt with:

* Missing data in the spawner groups needs to be explicitly denoted by `?` instead of NA.
But, in the user-supplied meta data we should still use NA if there is nothing known about it.
Only in cases where user wants to add the unknown spawner to within a comma-separated string
does the user code missing as ?.  (For example 4/11/204,?,3/12/2013).  However it is hard to imagine
that this is something anyone would ever need to do.

Stuff to discuss:

1. Multiple spawner groups and years with matchers.
2. Cross-hatchery and cross-sex matchers. Note cross-hatchery stuff is tough to fix, so we
make extra copies of individuals.  There is potential for self-assignment in those cases, so
we have named those copies so that it is easy to find them in the output and vet them.
3. The `system` and `system2` commands.  For now we are just going to keep it simple.
4. Temporary files and directories.
5. The `inst` directory and binaries (They don't fly with CRAN!).
