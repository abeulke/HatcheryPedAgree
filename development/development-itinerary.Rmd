# Topics for discussion during meetings

## Thursday, May 14, 2020

### 1. Installing packages

Make sure this is done:
```r
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "knitr", "styler"))
```

### 2. Code style

This is **mandatory** reading: 
[https://style.tidyverse.org/](https://style.tidyverse.org/), at least, for
now, Chapters 1--7.

### 3. Roxygen

Make sure that the configurations are done on their projects. See and
follow directions at:  
[https://r-pkgs.org/man.html#man-workflow-2](https://r-pkgs.org/man.html#man-workflow-2)

Note that we have:
```
Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)
```
in the `DESCRIPTION` file.


### 4. Forking and Pull requests

Let's follow through the packages book.

```sh
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
```

Also set up upstream:
```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/eriqande/HatcheryPedAgree.git
```

Then, any time you want to get new commits from the upstream repo, you do:
```sh
git fetch upstream
```
That "fetches" the objects.

And, to merge them into your current branch, once they are fetched, you do:
```sh
git merge upstream/master
```

To be able to pull upstream into the current branch, you can set that up
with:
```sh
git branch -u upstream/master   
```

Then, to pull it into master you can:
```sh
git checkout master
git pull
```



Be sure to get `upstream` set up.  Then run through the pull request procedure.


### 5. Data sets 

What format are these currently in?  I want to to have both of
the steelhead data sets in a canonical form to be in this project,
but have them gitignored. Then I will put the coho SNPs up on GitHub
for running through examples, etc.

I will send a specification of what I want, once I have figured
that out, and then Anne and Laura can email those to me and I can put them
together in a directory that we can send out to everyone.  That way we
can all test new functions on these private data sets.

**DON'T COMMIT THESE DATA SETS TO THE REPO!**
