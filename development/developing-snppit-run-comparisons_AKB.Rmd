```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(HatcheryPedAgree)

# I am going to use the RR stuff
sex_and_date <- read_rds("../private/rrsh_metadata.rds")

#my_nosad <- slurp_snppit(
#  DIR = "~/Documents/UnsyncedData/HatcheryPedAgreeOutputs/RussianRiver-July-6-2020/snppit-run-noSAD",
#  S = sex_and_date
#)
#write_rds(my_nosad, path = "../private/rr-results/nosad.rds", compress = "xz")

#my_sad <- slurp_snppit(
#  DIR = "~/Documents/UnsyncedData/HatcheryPedAgreeOutputs/RussianRiver-July-6-2020/snppit-run-dir",
#  S = sex_and_date
#)
#write_rds(my_sad, path = "../private/rr-results/sad.rds", compress = "xz")

#reorg <- read_rds("~/Documents/UnsyncedData/HatcheryPedAgreeOutputs/RussianRiver-July-6-2020/reorg.rds")

my_nosad <- read_rds("../private/rr-results/nosad.rds")
my_sad <- read_rds("../private/rr-results/sad.rds")

# now, put in a list to prep_to_compare:
L <- list(
  nosad = my_nosad,
  sad = my_sad
)
```


Now, we can create a data frame that compares the two.  This will be useful for filtering:
```{r}
D3 <- prep_to_compare_snppit_runs(L)
```


Make a plot:
```{r}
ggplot(D3 %>% filter(!is.na(kid_hatchery)), aes(x = idx_by_year_and_hatchery, y = FDR + 0.05 * (as.integer(type_f) - 1), colour = type_f)) +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0.05, colour = "white") +
    geom_point(shape = 21, stroke = 0.2, size = 1.2) +
    facet_grid(kid_min_year ~ kid_hatchery) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "red"))
```


Quick Check of some numbers
```{r}
D3 %>%
  group_by(kid_hatchery, kid_min_year) %>%
  summarise(
    tot = n(),
    lt01 = sum(FDR < 0.01, na.rm = TRUE),
    lt05 = sum(FDR <= 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

And, we could also see how many total fish we think we get wrong when we apply rules
like FDR < 0.05 for unconstrained or FDR < 0.02 for constrained.

First, do just the constraineds....
```{r}
all_good_sads <- D3 %>%
  filter(
    type_of_analysis == "sad",
    FDR < 0.02,
    MaxP.Pr.Relat == "C_Se_Se"
) %>%
  arrange(FDR) %>%
  select(kid, FDR)

# that yields 10,550 assignments
# and then the number we think we might have gotten wrong that way is about 15.
sum(all_good_sads$FDR)

# so, less than 2 out of 1,000 are expected to be incorrect
```

Now, we remove those from the data set, and get the noSADs that still look good.
```{r}
additional_no_sads_05 <- D3 %>%
  filter(type_of_analysis == "nosad") %>%
  anti_join(all_good_sads, by = "kid") %>%
  filter(
    FDR < 0.05,
    MaxP.Pr.Relat == "C_Se_Se"
    ) %>%
  select(kid, FDR) %>%
  arrange(FDR)

# there are 386 of those.  
# And how many do we think we got wrong?
sum(additional_no_sads_05$FDR)

# About 7 of those...
# so, that is about 2% of those.  But the overall expected rate of errors is still
22 / (10550 + 386)

# which is about 2 in 1000.  
```
```{r}
#final data 
list_of_kids <- full_join(all_good_sads, additional_no_sads_05, by = "kid") %>% select(kid)

all_good_sads_info <- D3 %>%
  filter(
    type_of_analysis == "sad",
    FDR < 0.02,
    MaxP.Pr.Relat == "C_Se_Se"
) 

additional_no_sads_05_info <- D3 %>%
  filter(type_of_analysis == "nosad") %>%
  anti_join(all_good_sads, by = "kid") %>%
  filter(
    FDR < 0.05,
    MaxP.Pr.Relat == "C_Se_Se"
    ) 

final_data_to_test <- full_join(all_good_sads_info, additional_no_sads_05_info, by = "kid")
write_rds(final_data_to_test, "../outputs/HPA_final_data_test_July132020.rds")

```
