<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of HatcheryPedAgree is to automate the process of running
SNPPIT on large multi-generational hatchery data sets, and compare the
results of different runs, especially between runs that use meta data
(like sex and spawn date) and those that donâ€™t.

## Installation
