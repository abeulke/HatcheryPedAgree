# HatcheryPedAgree

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of HatcheryPedAgree is to automate the process of running SNPPIT on
large multi-generational hatchery data sets, and compare the results
of different runs, especially between runs that use meta data (like sex and
spawn date) and those that don't.
